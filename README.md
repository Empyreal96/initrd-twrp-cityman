# Repo containing my edits on the Nexus 6P TWRP Ramdisk working with the Lumia 950 XL (When I say working.. It boots and touch works, partitions will need to be manually reflected in the fstab)



Initial public upload, VERY basic and most things don't work.

NTFS rw support,

Linked to MY partition layout, Windows MainOS Drive as System, Windows Data as Internal, EFIESP as Boot
